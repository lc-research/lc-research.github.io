      <description>There are plenty of blogs on tech and gadgets. From big names like Engadget, Gizmodo and C|net to gazillian individual bloggers cover every possible gadget imaginable. Why would I write another tech blog. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this space crowded enough. My intention with this blog is not to compete with any other tech blog. This blog is a by product of my attempt to document some tech stuff.
I dread doing repetitive tasks.</description>
