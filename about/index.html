			<p>There are plenty of blogs on tech and gadgets. From big names like Engadget, Gizmodo and C|net to gazillian individual bloggers cover every possible gadget imaginable. Why would I write another tech blog. Isn&rsquo;t this space crowded enough. My intention with this blog is not to compete with any other tech blog.

<p>I dread doing repetitive tasks. Technology helped me immensely to automate things and simplify my life. Implementing the right technology in the right way is no easy task, but the initial effort is worth the reward in the long run. A substantial amount of work must be done to find the right solution and technology for the problem in hand. A significant amount of time has to be spent on product research to find the right equipment or software at a reasonable cost. Even with all these efforts, things fail at times. Once in a while, I need to go back and fix something or reconfigure some software that I setup ages ago. As time goes by I tend to forget things, or I recall them incorrectly. I just need to repeat the exact same steps in the exact same order. I wish I had written down how to do X,Y and Z somewhere.</p>
<p>While I was documenting some tech stuff, I thought, &ldquo;why not make these available to others through my personal blog&rdquo;. Someone might actually benefit from the stuff that I write. This is what motivated me to bring this blog to you.</p>
<p>I hope to share my thoughts or expertise on certain technologies through this blog. I will also post tutorials on various topics that interest me. Some posts are documentations for future me. Each blog post starts with a small summary about the problem. These summaries, accessible from the front page should give you an idea about the post&rsquo;s content. I hope at least some of these posts will be useful to you. Happy Reading!!</p>
